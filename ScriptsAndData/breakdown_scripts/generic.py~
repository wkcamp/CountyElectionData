"""
This script serves to provide a generic way to process texts grouped like so:

Wanted Info
Unwanted
Unwanted
Wanted Info
Unwanted
Unwanted
etc...

To do this, this script takes an input "padding" which designates the space between the precinct names within a script. Once all precincts are collected, the script collects the first batch of yes votes and no votes and uses a 1-1 correspondence to align them.
